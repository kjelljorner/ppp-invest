  abstract = {Molecules where the first excited singlet state is lower in energy than the first excited triplet state have been discovered which have the potential to revolutionize OLEDs.           ,                             Molecules where the first excited singlet state is lower in energy than the first excited triplet state have the potential to revolutionize OLEDs. This inverted singlet–triplet gap violates Hund's rule and currently there are only a few molecules which are known to have this property. Here, we screen the complete set of non-alternant hydrocarbons consisting of 5-, 6-, 7-membered rings fused into two-, three- and four-ring polycyclic systems. We identify several molecules where the symmetry of the ground-state structure is broken due to bond-length alternation. Through symmetry-constrained optimizations we identify several molecular cores where the singlet–triplet gap is inverted when the structure is in a higher symmetry, pentalene being a known example. We uncover a strategy to stabilize the molecular cores into their higher-symmetry structures with electron donors or acceptors. We design several substituted pentalenes,               s               -indacenes, and indeno[1,2,3-               ef               ]heptalenes with inverted gaps, among which there are several synthetically known examples. In contrast to known inverted gap emitters, we identify the double-bond delocalized structure of their conjugated cores as the necessary condition to achieve the inverted gap. This strategy enables chemical tuning and paves the way for the rational design of polycyclic hydrocarbons with inverted singlet–triplet gaps. These molecules are prospective emitters if their properties can be optimized for use in OLEDs.},

  abstract = {Classification techniques have been applied to many applications in various fields of sciences. There are several ways of evaluating classification algorithms. The analysis of such metrics and its significance must be interpreted correctly for evaluating different learning algorithms. Most of these measures are scalar metrics and some of them are graphical methods. This paper introduces a detailed overview of the classification assessment measures with the aim of providing the basics of these measures and to show how it works to serve as a comprehensive source for researchers who are interested in this field. This overview starts by highlighting the definition of the confusion matrix in binary and multi-class classification problems. Many classification measures are also explained in details, and the influence of balanced and imbalanced data on each metric is presented. An illustrative example is introduced to show (1) how to calculate these measures in binary and multi-class classification problems, and (2) the robustness of some measures against balanced and imbalanced data. Moreover, some graphical measures such as Receiver operating characteristics (ROC), Precision-Recall, and Detection error trade-off (DET) curves are presented with details. Additionally, in a step-by-step approach, different numerical examples are demonstrated to explain the preprocessing steps of plotting ROC, PR, and DET curves.},

  abstract     = {Data analysis often entails a multitude of heterogeneous steps, from the application of various command line tools to the usage of scripting languages like R or Python for the generation of plots and tables. It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way.~Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid.             Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

  abstract     = {In this contribution, we propose strategies in order to design emitters with an inverted singlet–triplet gap (INVEST) and non-vanishing emission properties based on symmetry considerations.           ,                             The inversion of the lowest singlet and triplet excited state energy gaps, in fully organic triangle-based compounds, can give rise to new exergonic pathways to enhance the performance of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), going beyond the novel yet promising thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) mechanism. The origin of this inversion, arises from the interplay between exchange and electron correlation effects and has been extensively investigated in the last few years, using wavefunction-based methods. However, a proper picture of the structure–property relationships characterizing these systems is still lacking. In this study, we thus assessed the effect of different symmetry point groups (               D               3h               ,               C               2v               ,               C               3h               and               C               3v               ) on the orbital localization to shed light on the role played by symmetry in determining the optical features of the triangulene systems (on both S               1               –T               1               inversion and oscillator strengths). The presence of the               C               2               axis and               σ               v               plane (as in the               D               3h               ,               C               2v               and               C               3v               groups) turned out to be critical for ensuring proper orbital localization aimed at minimizing exchange interaction, therefore favouring the inversion process. In particular, adopting the               C               2v               (and its subgroups) symmetry through a proper doping pattern of the triangulene core, by introducing substituents or by merging two triangulene cores, is the only way to achieve a negative Δ               E               ST               and a non-zero oscillator strength. Finally, we summarized the lessons learnt from this analysis to establish a series of design rules aimed at helping the identification of inverted singlet–triplet (INVEST) emitters for applications in next-generation OLEDs.},

The calculations at the               ab initio               levels show that the singlet–triplet gap is inverted as compared to the one expected from Hund's rule, whereas all density functionals yield the triplet state as the lowest excited state.

Employing the spin-flip and ΔSCF methods, singlet–triplet inversion was obtained at the density functional theory level for some of the studied molecules.},

To navigate this space, classical workflows rely on the domain knowledge and creativity of human experts, which can be the bottleneck in high-throughput approaches. Herein, we present an artificial molecular design workflow relying on a genetic algorithm and a deep neural network to find a new family of organic emitters with inverted singlet-triplet gaps and appreciable fluorescence rates. We combine high-throughput virtual screening and inverse design infused with domain knowledge and artificial intelligence to accelerate molecular generation significantly. This enabled us to explore more than 800,000 potential emitter molecules and find more than 10,000 candidates estimated to have inverted singlet-triplet gaps (INVEST) and appreciable fluorescence rates, many of which likely emit blue light. This class of molecules has the potential to realize a new generation of organic light-emitting diodes.},

Both precision and recall are therefore based on relevance.  Consider a computer program for recognizing dogs (the relevant element) in a digital photograph. Upon processing a picture which contains ten cats and twelve dogs, the program identifies eight dogs. Of the eight elements identified as dogs, only five actually are dogs (true positives), while the other three are cats (false positives). Seven dogs were missed (false negatives), and seven cats were correctly excluded (true negatives). The program's precision is then 5/8 (true positives / selected elements) while its recall is 5/12 (true positives / relevant elements). Adopting a hypothesis-testing approach from statistics, in which, in this case, the null hypothesis is that a given item is irrelevant (i.e., not a dog), absence of type I and type II errors (i.e., perfect specificity and sensitivity of 100\% each) corresponds respectively to perfect precision (no false positive) and perfect recall (no false negative).   More generally, recall is simply the complement of the type II error rate (i.e., one minus the type II error rate). Precision is related to the type I error rate, but in a slightly more complicated way, as it also depends upon the prior distribution of seeing a relevant vs. an irrelevant item. The above cat and dog example contained 8 − 5 = 3 type I errors (false positives) out of 10 total cats (true negatives), for a type I error rate of 3/10, and 12 − 5 = 7 type II errors, for a type II error rate of 7/12.  Precision can be seen as a measure of quality, and recall as a measure of quantity.  Higher precision means that an algorithm returns more relevant results than irrelevant ones, and high recall means that an algorithm returns most of the relevant results (whether or not irrelevant ones are also returned).},

  abstract = {One implication of Hund’s first rule for molecules is that the first excited triplet is for the large majority of molecules more stable than the first excited singlet. Only a handful of structural motifs are known to violate it. Recently, the potential of such molecules for emissive materials has been appreciated as their inverted singlet-triplet gaps enable favorable triplet exciton harvesting and low triplet exciton population to be utilized in both efficient and long-lived organic light-emitting diodes. Herein, we report bottom-up design of small organic molecules with inverted singlet-triplet gaps, i.e., INVEST molecules, via the Ring-Bonds-Substitutions (RiBS) ruleset which we introduce in this work. It relies on a few simple rules based on orbital interactions in alternant hydrocarbons to both minimize the exchange integral between highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and maximize dynamic spin polarization. Using RiBS, we find many new molecules violating Hund’s first rule in their first excited states thereby greatly expanding the chemical space of potential inverted singlet-triplet gap (INVEST) emitters.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article introduces MMFF94, the initial published version of the Merck molecular force field (MMFF). It describes the objectives set for MMFF, the form it takes, and the range of systems to which it applies. This study also outlines the methodology employed in parameterizing MMFF94 and summarizes its performance in reproducing computational and experimental data. Though similar to MM3 in some respects, MMFF94 differs in ways intended to facilitate application to condensed-phase processes in molecular-dynamics simulations. Indeed, MMFF94 seeks to achieve MM3-like accuracy for small molecules in a combined ?organic/protein? force field that is equally applicable to proteins and other systems of biological significance. A second distinguishing feature is that the core portion of MMFF94 has primarily been derived from high-quality computational data?ca. 500 molecular structures optimized at the HF/6-31G* level, 475 structures optimized at the MP2/6-31G* level, 380 MP2/6-31G* structures evaluated at a defined approximation to the MP4SDQ/TZP level, and 1450 structures partly derived from MP2/6-31G* geometries and evaluated at the MP2/TZP level. A third distinguishing feature is that MMFF94 has been parameterized for a wide variety of chemical systems of interest to organic and medicial chemists, including many that feature frequently occurring combinations of functional groups for which little, if any, useful experimental data are available. The methodology used in parameterizing MMFF94 represents a fourth distinguishing feature. Rather than using the common ?functional group? approach, nearly all MMFF parameters have been determined in a mutually consistent fashion from the full set of available computational data. MMFF94 reproduces the computational data used in its parameterization very well. In addition, MMFF94 reproduces experimental bond lengths (0.014 Å root mean square [rms]), bond angles (1.2° rms), vibrational frequencies (61 cm?1 rms), conformational energies (0.38 kcal/mol/rms), and rotational barriers (0.39 kcal/mol rms) very nearly as well as does MM3 for comparable systems. MMFF94 also describes intermolecular interactions in hydrogen-bonded systems in a way that closely parallels that given by the highly regarded OPLS force field. ? 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

In this Article, we describe the underlying theoretical formalism of the OMx methods and their implementation in full detail, and we report all relevant OMx parameters for hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine. For a standard set of mostly organic molecules commonly used in semiempirical method development, the OMx results are found to be superior to those from standard MNDO-type methods. Parametrized Grimme-type dispersion corrections can be added to OM2 and OM3 energies to provide a realistic treatment of noncovalent interaction energies, as demonstrated for the complexes in the S22 and S66×8 test sets.},

  abstract = {We present a new and simple scheme that aims to decompose into its main physical contributions the magnetic exchange interaction between two unpaired electrons. It is based on the popular broken-symmetry density functional theory (DFT) approach and relies on the frozen orbital capabilities of the local self-consistent field method. Accordingly, the magnetic exchange interaction energy can be separated into three main contributions: the direct exchange between magnetic orbitals, the spin polarization of the core orbitals, and the relaxation of the magnetic orbitals (kinetic exchange). This decomposition scheme is applied to a series of binuclear inorganic magnetic compounds both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic. The direct exchange is determined from the restricted DFT description. On the one hand, starting from the restricted orbital set and relaxing only the magnetic orbitals provides the kinetic exchange contribution and an estimate of the t and U parameters of the generalized Anderson mechanism. On the other hand, relaxing the core orbitals only introduces the spin polarization contribution. The decomposition leads to almost additive contributions. The effect of the amount of Hartree-Fock exchange on the different contributions is analyzed.},
