  abstract = {Violation of Hund's multiplicity rule in the electronically excited states of conjugated hydrocarbons is studied by using the Pariser–Parr–Pople type SCF MO method and the abinitio MO method with STO-3G basis set, both methods being augmented by CI-type treatments. It is shown that for symmetrical structures (D               2h               ) of the nonalternant hydrocarbons, propalene, pentalene, and heptalene, the lowest excited singlet state is energetically lower than the corresponding triplet state. This is mainly due to the spin polarization (SP) effects. For D               2h               , structures of pentalene and heptalene the open-shell excited singlet state is predicted to be lower in energy than the closed-shell state, with the result that the former is really the ground state. Further, calculations made by including electron correlation effects reveal that in linear polyenes and polyacenes, the lowest excited singlet "minus" state (using Pariser's classification of the alternancy symmetry species) is lower in energy than the corresponding triplet state. The energy lowering of the singlet "minus" state in linear polyenes is due mostly to the mixing with the doubly excited configurations (mm\hspace{0.6em}→\hspace{0.6em}nn), while the considerable part of it in polyacenes is due to the SP effects.},

  abstract = {The π-bonding energies and resonance energies for a series of monocyclic polymethines (CH)n, and several benzenoid and nonbenzenoid hydrocarbons are calculated by the Hückel, Pople, and SPO methods. Special attention is paid to the formulation and definition of such energy terms. For simplicity equal bond lengths are assumed in each case; in the case of the polymethines, the planar configurations of regular polygons are taken.             The calculated π-bonding energies of 11 benzenoid hydrocarbons are combined with experimental heats of formation and an assumed carbon—hydrogen bond energy to obtain estimates of the bond energy of a carbon—carbon σ bond in an aromatic ring. The values obtained for the eleven compounds agree very closely, implying that a good estimate of the heat of formation of such hydrocarbons can be obtained by adding the σ-bond energies to the calculated π energy. This approach is used to estimate resonance energies of the aromatic hydrocarbons.             The resonance energies of the polymethines are found to alternate strongly, regardless of the choice of methods used; the values are uniformly larger for rings with 4n+2 π electrons than for rings with 4n π electrons. In the Pople and SPO cases, bond alternation is predicted for all the rings with 4n carbon atoms as well as for those with 4n+2 carbon atoms starting at n=4.             For certain nonbenzenoid hydrocarbons the calculated resonance energies are only in fair agreement with experimental findings. For most, agreement is satisfactory.},

  abstract = {Molecules where the first excited singlet state is lower energy than the first excited triplet state have the potential to revolutionize OLEDs. This inverted singlet-triplet gap violates Hund’s rule and currently there are only a few molecules which are known to have this property. Here, we screen the complete set of non-alternant hydrocarbons consisting of 5-, 6-, 7-membered rings fused into two-, three- and four-ring polycyclic systems. We identify several molecules where the symmetry of the ground-state structure is broken due to bond-length alternation. Through symmetry-constrained optimizations we identify several molecular cores where the singlet-triplet gap is inverted when the structure is in a higher symmetry, pentalene being a known example. We uncover a strategy to stabilize the molecular cores into their higher-symmetry structures with electron donors or acceptors. We design several substituted pentalenes, s-indacenes, and indeno[1,2,3-ef]heptalenes with inverted gaps, among which there are several synthetically known examples. In contrast to known inverted gap emitters, we identify the double-bond delocalized structure of their conjugated cores as the necessary condition to achieve the inverted gap. This strategy enables chemical tuning and paves the way for the rational design of polycyclic hydrocarbons with inverted singlet-triplet gaps. These molecules are prospective emitters if their properties can be optimized for use in OLEDs.},

Rephrasing this rule for molecular excited states predicts a positive energy gap between spin-singlet and spin-triplet excited states, as has been consistent with numerous experimental observations over almost a century. Here we report a fluorescent molecule that disobeys Hund’s rule and has a negative singlet–triplet energy gap of −11\,±\,2\,meV. The energy inversion of the singlet and triplet excited states results in delayed fluorescence with short time constants of 0.2\,μs, which anomalously decrease with decreasing temperature owing to the emissive singlet character of the lowest-energy excited state. Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) using this molecule exhibited a fast transient electroluminescence decay with a peak external quantum efficiency of 17\%, demonstrating its potential implications for optoelectronic devices, including displays, lighting and lasers.},

It is particularly challenging to discover new ones through virtual screening because the required wavefunction-based methods are expensive and unsuitable for high-throughput calculations. Here, we devised a virtual screening approach where the molecules to be considered with advanced methods are pre-selected with increasingly more sophisticated filters that include the evaluation of the HOMO-LUMO exchange integral and approximate CASSCF calculations. A final set of 7 candidates (0.05\textbackslash\% of the initial 15000) were verified to possess inversion between singlet and triplet states with state-of-the-art multireference methods (MS--CASPT2). One of them is deemed of particular interest because it is unrelated to other proposals made in the literature.},

As such, ordinary DFT cannot treat time-dependent (TD) problems nor describe excited electronic states. In 1984, Runge and Gross proved a theorem making TD-DFT formally exact. Information about electronic excited states may be obtained from this theory through the linear response (LR) theory formalism. Beginning in the mid-1990s, LR-TD-DFT became increasingly popular for calculating absorption and other spectra of medium- and large-sized molecules. Its ease of use and relatively good accuracy has now brought LR-TD-DFT to the forefront for this type of application. As the number and the diversity of applications of TD-DFT have grown, so too has our understanding of the strengths and weakness...},

  abstract = {The new generation of proposed light-emitting molecules for OLEDs has raised a considerable research interest due to its exceptional feature-a negative singlet-triplet (ST) gap violating the Hund's multiplicity rule in the excited S1 and T1 states. We investigate the role of spin polarization in the mechanism of ST gap inversion. Spin polarization is associated with doubly excited determinants of certain types, whose presence in the wavefunction expansion favors the energy of the singlet state more than that of the triplet. Using a perturbation theory-based model for spin polarization, we propose a simple descriptor for prescreening of candidate molecules with negative ST gaps and prove its usefulness for heptazine-type molecules. Numerical results show that the quantitative effect of spin polarization is approximately inverse-proportional to the HOMO-LUMO exchange integral. Comparison of single- and multireference coupled- cluster predictions of ST gaps shows that the former methods provide good accuracy by correctly balancing the effects of doubly excited determinants and dynamic correlation. We also show that accurate ST gaps may be obtained using a complete active space model supplemented with dynamic correlation from multireference adiabatic connection theory.},

Therefore, the up-converted reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from T               1               to S               1               is an endothermic process, which may lead to the quenching of long-lived triplet excitons in electroluminescence, and subsequently the reduction of device efficiency. Interestingly, organic molecules with inverted singlet-triplet (INVEST) gaps in violation of Hund’s multiplicity rule have recently come into the limelight. The unique feature has attracted extensive attention in the fields of organic optoelectronics and photocatalysis over the past few years. For an INVEST molecule possessing a higher T               1               with respect to S               1               , namely a negative Δ               E               ST               , the down-converted RISC from T               1               to S               1               does not require thermal activation, which is possibly conducive to solving the problems of fast efficiency roll-off and short lifetime of organic light-emitting devices. By virtue of this property, INVEST molecules are recently regarded as a new generation of organic light-emitting materials. In this review, we briefly summarized the significant progress of INVEST molecules in both theoretical calculations and experimental studies, and put forward suggestions and expectations for future research.},
